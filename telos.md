# TELOS

## DOCUMENT PURPOSE

This document captures the TELOS method of articulating a person's personal context so that they, and AI, can better understand them and help them improve. Pay attention to the items and the concepts here, and especially on how they work together.

The conceptual path is Problems -> Mission -> (Narratives) -> Goals -> Challenges -> Strategies -> Projects -> Journal. This means that any project you're doing can be mapped all the way back up to the problem(s) you're trying to solve. This gives you transparency and explainability in everything you're doing so you don't end up busy for days/months/years without being able to remember why you're doing what you're doing.

Other sections that aren't those core sections are additional context to support them.

## HISTORY

- I grew up in the Reinbek, Germany
- I went to Gymnasium Glinde in Glinde, Germany

## PROBLEMS

- P1: The school system is absolutely terrible
- P2: Many tools are packed with unwanted stuff or bloatware, and try to do more then they are made for
- P3: Staying motivated is hard when adults are never believing in you or never even listen

## MISSION

- M1: Create useful no bs tools that just work

## NARRATIVES

- N1: School is evil.
- N2: Learning is way easier in your own, comfortable environment
 
## GOALS

- G1: Make an Open Source project with 100+ stars on GitHub by 2027
- G2: Make my business Harbourscapes successful by 2030
- G3: Make my own complete operating system by 2035
- G4: Get my Pilot's license (PPL) by 2030 
- G5: Contribute to a major open source project

## SHORT TERM GOALS

- S1: Finish the go backend for hcs by September 2025
- S2: Build the mobile app using Electron and Nuxt.js for hcs by September 2025
- S3: Build the telescope GoTo device by September 2025
- S4: Finish VyOS config for the robotics club by August 2025


## CHALLENGES

- C1: School is taking away too much of valuable time I could spend doing something actually productive
- C2: I hate GUIs, especially when they are bloated like windows
- C3: Coding UIs is way too difficult, i think it would be easier to teach everyone how to read json and skip frontend entirely.

## THINGS I'VE BEEN WRONG ABOUT

- Thought regex was easy. Found out the hard way.
- I thought Elon Musk was a cool guy.

## IDEAS

- I1: Schools should teach coding earlier and in more hands-on ways
- I2: TUIs are better than GUIs
- I3: All APIs should follow some sort of standard.

## PREDICTIONS

- WW4 will be fought using sticks and stones (80%)
- School systems around the world won't modernize in the next 15 years (75%)

## BEST MOVIES

- Interstellar
- Inception

## BEST BOOKS

- Woodwalkers
- Warrior Cats
- Keeper of the lost cities

## WISDOM

- Don't wait to be older. Build now.
- Making bad code is better than not making anything.
- If you're stuck, try rewriting it from scratch.

## METRICS

- K1: Launch my first original product by 2027

## TRAUMAS

- None so far

## LOG (Journal)

- 26/06/25: Wrote my first TELOS. Took longer than expected.
